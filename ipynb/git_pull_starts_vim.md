What to do if 'git pull' starts 'vim'?
You're in the text editor, vim! It's a modal text editor, so you would need to:

- Press i to enter insert mode.
- Now you can type your message, as if you were in a normal (non-modal) text editor.
- Press esc to go back to command mode.
- Then type :w followed by enter to save.
- Finally :q followed by enter to quit.
